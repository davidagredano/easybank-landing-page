This project is a mock landing page for a fintech app.

The main goal of this project was to practice my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, and to gain experience working with CSS and HTML preprocessors, enhance the website's development process and add those technologies to my tech stack.

## Features 

- **HTML and CSS Preprocessors**: I worked with Pug for writing the HTML and with SASS for the CSS. In SCSS I practised working with mixins with and without parameters, variables, nesting and composing in partials.
- **CSS Architecture**: The project adheres to the BEM CSS methodology, a popular naming convention for CSS classes, which helped to keep the code clean, readable, and maintainable.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is built to be completely responsive, providing a seamless user experience across all devices.
- **JavaScript Functionality**:  The project involved using JavaScript for some functionalities around the toggle menu in mobile display.
